* The Order View, Ignore, etc must be maintained per order, user and state.
* The Trader Info Detail must be expanded ... I am not really sure what to add in there
* The Trader Dashboard may include several things:
* => Top 10 Items
* => Top Trader Partners
* => Year To Date Figures
* I can no longer include the old EF 4.3 in projects (i.e. tests). Hence we might have to upgrade to EF 5.x. But 
there are several things:
*=> EF 5.x requires .NET 4.5
*=> .NET 4.5 is not supported yet on Windows Azure!!
* (DONE) The View Models that Adarsh added require refactoring as they do not belong properly in the right bins
* I would like to include a DataServiceController in each area! This will help reducing the data service code and make things more meaningful.
* The conversion rates in dashboards are not working well.
* I have to make the Date Fields in the Model classes accept NULL dates....not sure how to do this.
